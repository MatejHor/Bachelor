abstract = "Breast cancer is among the leading cause of mortality among women in developing as well as under-developing countries. The detection and classification of breast cancer in the early stages of its development may allow patients to have proper treatment. In this article, we proposed a novel deep learning framework for the detection and classification of breast cancer in breast cytology images using the concept of transfer learning. In general, deep learning architectures are modeled to be problem specific and is performed in isolation. Contrary to classical learning paradigms, which develop and yield in isolation, transfer learning is aimed to utilize the gained knowledge during the solution of one problem into another related problem. In the proposed framework, features from images are extracted using pre-trained CNN architectures, namely, GoogLeNet, Visual Geometry Group Network (VGGNet) and Residual Networks (ResNet), which are fed into a fully connected layer for classification of malignant and benign cells using average pooling classification. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, experiments are performed on standard benchmark data sets. It has been observed that the proposed framework outclass all the other deep learning architectures in terms of accuracy in detection and classification of breast tumor in cytology images."

    abstract = "{Segmentation and detection of mitotic nuclei is a challenging task. To address this problem, a Transfer Learning based fast and accurate system is proposed. To give the classifier a balanced dataset, this work exploits the concept of Transfer Learning by first using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) for segmentation, and then another Hybrid-CNN (with Weights Transfer and custom layers) for classification of mitoses. First, mitotic nuclei are automatically annotated, based on the ground truth centroids. The segmentation module then segments mitotic nuclei and also produces some false positives. Finally, the detection module is trained on the patches from the segmentation module and performs the final detection. Fine-tuning based Transfer Learning reduced training time, provided good initial weights, and improved the detection rate with F-measure of 0.713 and 76\\% area under the precision-recall curve for the challenging task of mitosis detection.}",
